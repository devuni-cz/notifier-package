Create a PHPUnit test for the Laravel package that:

-   Extends the proper Laravel test base class
-   Uses Laravel's testing helpers and assertions
-   Mocks external dependencies properly
-   Tests both success and failure scenarios
-   Includes setup and teardown methods if needed
-   Uses descriptive test method names
-   Follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
-   Tests all public methods of the class
-   Uses data providers for multiple test scenarios
-   Includes edge case testing
